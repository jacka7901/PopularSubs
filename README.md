# **PopularSubs**
## **Jack Arnold** 
PopularSubs is a program that grabs the top 25 subreddits from the Reddit.com homepage, and adds them to a database where they will be ranked by 'most appearances' over time. The ultimate goal is to be able to compare reddit's most popular subreddits to the subreddits with the most appearnces on the homepage.
